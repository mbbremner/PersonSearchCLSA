# PersonSearchCLSA
This is a reconstruction from scratch of a deep network, based on a technique outlined in the compouter vision paper "Person Search by Multi-Scale Matching". The model is built upon a modified ResNet-50 backbone. The purpose of the technique is to boost the performance of person search by reinforcing semantic alignment across layers.
